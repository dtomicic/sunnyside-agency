## Project task
Task was to build the landing page following the design, with some JavaScript for mobile navigation.

## Project overview
Project started out good, ran into some problems with nav but managed to solved it, then had some problems with images on page resizing too much, haven't been able to solve it fully but I've made it look kind of okay but it could definitely use more work. Other than that nothing else was much of a challenge since it's simple pictures and text positiong and styling.

Project could use more work fine tuning some of the stuff but even without it looks decent enough.
